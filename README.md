# db-thingy
Small command line app for connecting to databases

# Aim

I want to be able to connect to a database from command line without remembering database connection strings or passwords.
Since it's common (particularly in Ruby on Rails) to check these credentials into the project this was simply trying to save me some copy pasting..


## ToDo

- Connect to databases from different environments
- Connect to different types of databases
- Determine what language the project is and try to look for database credentials in common places
- Set global database connections in a dot file?
